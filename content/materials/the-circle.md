## Roots, seeds, ideas.

Commune. Struggle. Remember. Transform.

A ritual card game for collectives committed to changing the world. A world committed to changing us. We need to tell stories to remember ourselves. We need to share imaginaries to act. We need us to transform. Words to know what comes next.

This is a game that is intended to be played by affinity groups and organizations, or close groups of friends. It is as much a collaborative organizational tool as it is a playful game. It is meant to help us build a collective poetics of resistance. It is in many ways a scaffolding mechanic, once we have reclaimed storytelling we do not need this game. It is also a game that attempts to help us strengthen solidarity between us and coordinate our efforts in changing the world for the better.

It is in a way a continuation or a second edition of Dreams of Fire From Void. But in many ways they are complementary. Where Dreams of Fire From Void dealt with responsibility and consequences of our imagination, The Circle: Dreams of Roots is a game about community and collective ancestry and futures.
